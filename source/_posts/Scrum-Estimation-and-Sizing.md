In this article I will discuss some estimation and velocity concepts when using the Scrum framework. These are often needed in order to answer questions like: How many features can be completed in a sprint? How much time (sprints) will it take to finish a release? How much will it cost (time and money). More importantly, doing team based estimation can prevent ambiguitiy and result in better commitment and expectations overall.

## Why estimation is important
* **Size vs count in velocity** - Not all PBIs have the same size, if we calculate the velocity later on with the count we get a skewed velocity. By using sized PBIs we get a better average velocity over time. Estimation comes with time and experience, it's a skill.
* **Promoting discussions** -  Asking teammembers to put a number on something forces conversations so agreements and disagreements surface on time.

## Estimation levels
In most organizations we can estimate on three different levels of details:
* Portfolio backlog
* Product backlog
* Sprint backlog

### Portfolio backlog estimation
At this stage we usually don't have a complete overview of the items. For this stage we can use rough estimation, one method is to use T-shirt size for item estimation in the portfolio backlog: XS, S, M, L, XL etc.

### Product backlog estimation
Estimating product backlog items is part of the grooming process. Most teams prefer to use numeric size estimation: story points. Core concepts:

*  **Estimate as a team** - people doing the work do the estimation (development team), not the product owner and ScrumMaster.
* **Estimates are not commitments** - if people need to estimate while taking into commitment expectations from manager the estimates will get bigger and skewed as they want to play safe. This demotivates and result in an inaccurate estimation.
* **Focus on accuray, not precision** - too much precission results in diminishing returns of accuracy.
* Use relative sizes - people are better at relative size estimation than absolute estimation.
* **Story points** - influenced by several factors including complexity and physical size. Items can be big or small by complexityand/or physically.

Technique or sizing PBIs as a team: Planning Poker using cards and estimation scale. Often used scale based on a modified Fibonacci sequence or powers:
* **Fibonacci** - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100
* **Powers** - 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ...

When playing planning poker we don't go for average estimation but for consensus.

### Sprint backlog estimation
This is the most detailed level, most teams choose to estimate using **ideal-hours** (a.k.a. effort-hours, man-hours, person-hours etc.). Notice that ideal-hours is not same as elapsed hours. If the estimated ideal hours is 2-hours this doesn't mean 2 elapsed hour as the 2 ideal hours can be spread throughout several days. It is about the expected effort needed.

## Velocity
Velocity is the amount of work completed each sprint and can be measured by adding the sized PBIs by the end of the sprint. It is important that it measures the output of *what* was delivered and not the value.

Velocity can be used for:
* Planning, how much can be done and how many sprints are needed?
* Diagnostic metric, how good/efficient is the team working. usefull for improve the scrum process. Don't misuse velocity as performance metric, this can result in wasteful and dangerous behaviour.
